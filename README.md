# Montreal Collision Severity Project
This project investigates whether machine learning models can predict road collisions in MontrÃ©al using 200K+ real-world traffic reports.

The pipeline integrates spatial, temporal, and contextual features (engineered with OSMnx and domain knowledge) to model collision risk. Logistic Regression serves as a baseline, while Random Forest achieves 91% AUROC, significantly outperforming baseline methods.

## ðŸ“Š Results

### Geospatial Visualization
Historical collision density across MontrÃ©al (200K+ reports).  
This highlights high-risk areas such as downtown MontrÃ©al and major intersections.

## TTechnical Details
- **Language & Libraries**: Python, scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, OSMnx, Folium  
- **Models**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, Calibration, Confusion Matrices  
- **Features**:  
  - Temporal (hour, day, month, weekday, season, rush hour, is_night)  
  - Spatial (latitude, longitude, route categories)  
  - Contextual (environment, road conditions, weather, etc.)  

---

## ðŸš§ Ongoing Work
- Extending geospatial visualization to **predicted risk maps** (model-based, not just historical).  
- Adding temporal layers (e.g., rush hour vs late night, seasonal trends).  
- Experimenting with deep learning models for spatio-temporal prediction.  
- Possible deployment via Streamlit/Dash for interactive exploration.  

---

##  Why This Matters
- **Urban planning**: identify high-risk intersections and corridors.  
- **Public safety**: support proactive interventions based on risk profiles.  
- **Applied ML**: real-world example of classification, feature engineering, and model interpretability.

##  Status
This is an **ongoing project**. Current focus is on robust evaluation and exploratory visualization; extensions to deployment and predictive risk mapping are planned.
